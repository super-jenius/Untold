Future features
===============
Toggle "Enable music" instead of changing individual volumes.
Notification messages, assuming they support text.
Mission turn in - Send Report.
Attach lore and mission starters to objects/NPCs. Continue to support current lore model as well.
Way to turn off NPC dialog while you are in range.
Automatic translation of item/npc names for German/French clients, using string XML files.
Possible to use in-world items like you can in missions or with lore?
Saduff: Do you think you could also change the tier back and forward buttons from chevrons to something bigger so that they can be clicked faster?
